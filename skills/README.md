# Agent skills

Task-focused instructions for AI agents working in this repository. Each folder holds one
`SKILL.md` with `name`/`description` frontmatter, following the Agent Skills format.
`AGENTS.md` stays the always-loaded summary; these skills hold the detail an agent needs only
for a particular task.

Keep a skill short and current. When a command, path or default changes, update the skill in
the same change; a stale skill misleads more than a missing one.
